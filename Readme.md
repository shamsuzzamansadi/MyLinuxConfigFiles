# My Linux Config Files 
This are my personal config files for different tools that I use on my regular life in Linux. This includes:
1. Doom Emacs
2. Alacritty
3. Zsh

Those 3 are my daily tools that I need for my personal and professional works.

**NOTE:** The doom emacs logo came from this repository: https://github.com/jeetelongname/doom-banners
